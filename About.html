      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        From a young age, I was fascinated by technology — my mom loves to remind me that I could turn on the computer by
         myself before I even started school. What began as curiosity soon grew into passion when I took Computer Science as
          a subject and quickly became one of the top performers in my batch. Alongside my love for tech, I’ve always been driven
           by teamwork and competition — I’m a state gold medalist in basketball and korfball, and proudly served as my high
            school’s Sports Captain.</p>
      <p>
Today, that same drive fuels my journey in San Francisco, where I’m pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at 
San Francisco State University. Here, I’ve expanded my skills in AI, automation, and full-stack development,
 building real-world systems that blend creativity with code. My projects range from AI-powered agents that automate
  hiring and data workflows to personal apps like SharpenMyMind, which helps students form AI-assisted study groups.</p>
      <p>
I currently serve as an OpenAI Student Ambassador, teaching peers how to responsibly use AI for research and learning.
 I also founded the AI Agents Club at San Francisco State University, a growing student community exploring the future of
 automation and intelligent systems. Previously, I worked as an AI and Automation Intern at Dreamable, where I designed 
 end-to-end workflows using GPT, RAG, and n8n — automating everything from document processing to recruitment pipelines.</p>
      <p>
For me, technology isn’t just about code — it’s about curiosity, creation, and connection. Whether I’m mentoring students,
 managing a team of developers, or experimenting with new frameworks, I’m motivated by the same question that started it all:
  what more can we make possible with technology?
